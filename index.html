	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p> We often avoid interacting with people we don&#39t know well&#8212;it&#39s awkward, it&#39s unpredictable, we&#39re unsure of other&#39s interest in connecting. But, a study by University of Chicago professor of behavioral science Nicholas Epley titled <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001" title="Mistakenly Seeking Solitude: Nicholas Epley">"Mistakenly Seeking Solitude?"</a> shows that simple interactions with strangers can improve our wellbeing. </p>
				<p> People&#39s increased preference for solitude, aided by all of the opportunities we have for digital interactions or non-interactions (like scrolling through social media or lurking on internet forums), can interrupt our ability to make connections on a whim. As a deeply introverted person, I know this feeling all too well! As a person deeply invested in social wellness, I couldn&#39t let this literature pass me by. </p>		
				<p>Over the past couple years, this counterintuitive truth has ruminated in my head and influenced my actions. I hope to offer a reflection on the joys I have found in embracing unexpected interactions by mapping all of the chance encounters I had in one week. </p>

			<h3>Purpose and Process</h3>
					<p> The chance encounters project takes inspiration from Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject" title ="Dear Data">Dear Data </a>
						project. Each week for a year, Lupi and Posavec collected and measured data about their lives and mailed the results to each other. Dear Data disrupts our idea of how data visualizations should look&#8212;sleek, simple, and quick-to-process. The project advocates for <a href="http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold"> data humanism</a>, which involves high-dimensional data visualizations that connect numbers to the people behind them, and require time and intention to understand. 
						</p>
					<p>One reason why I love being a college student is because it’s impossible to walk across campus 
						without seeing someone you know. The following visualizations act as my data-driven diary to support 
						that experience. I collected data on each of the chance encounters I had between February 28 and March 6. 
						Whenever I mentioned this project to a friend (many of whom are in this dataset) their first question was, 
						“What counts as a chance encounter?” I’ve settled on the loose definition: A verbal interaction with a person 
						whom I was not expecting to see. </p>
					<p>The data collection consisted of pleasant interactions with people I know, and then a quick trip to my Notes 
						app to jot down the Date, Time, First Name, Last Name, Relationship (a description of how I know the person 
						for my own reference), a Relationship Category (colleague, acquaintance, friend, etc.), Activity (what I was 
						doing when I had the chance encounter, for my own reference), Duration (quick hello, short conversation, long 
						conversation), In Transit (a yes/no variable recording whether I was walking between locations) , How often I see the 
						person, Location (qualitative description), and latitude/longitude coordinates.</p>
					<p>This project seeks to support the idea that connecting with strangers, acquaintances, and friends through 
						chance encounters is an underrated exercise for practicing compassion and understanding. </p>
			<h3>Hand-Drawn Visualization</h3>
					<p>Below is the centerpiece of the project, a hand-drawn visualization. Each line on the visualization represents
						 a different day, and each circle represents a chance encounter. A combination of size, color, line, and shadow 
						 describe the interaction.</p>
					<img src="handdrawn3.png" class = img>
					<p>I noticed that I run into a near equal number of close friends, friends, acquaintances, and colleagues. I tend to have longer conversations with my close friends and colleagues, and shorter interactions with friends and acquaintances.</p>

			<h3>The Counts are What Counts</h3>
			<p>After one week of mapping my chance encounters, I learned a lot about myself and my routines. 
				In total, I had <b>116</b> chance encounters. <b>73</b> of those encounters happened 
				while I was in transit—walking between locations. That means about <b>63%</b> of my chance 
				encounters occurred while I was walking. 			
				<br><br>I had chance encounters with  <b>84</b> unique people. 
				Of course, I encountered one person more than anyone else. I had <b>4</b> unexpected
				interactions with my suitemate, Ginny. The race for second was contentious, too. 
				I saw my friends Aubrey, Chelsea, Kevin, Matt, Max, Selene, and Tyler <b>3</b> 
				times each.</p>
				<p>The table and accompanying line graph compare the number of chance encounters for each day with the number of location changes on the same day. In general, I have more chance encounters when I change locations often. This trend is unsurprising, as the majority of my chance encounters happen during while in transit. Location changes allow you to encounter people walking the opposite direction, especially when the location change involves some sort of communal travel like walking in public or taking the bus. Interactions like these make the journey between locations feel worthwhile, and provide a snap back to reality for moments when our mind wanders.</p>

			<h3>Interactive Map of Interactions, Mapped</h3>
				<p>Each chance encounter is plotted as a point on a map of the William & Mary campus. The map provides an indication of my and student hubs on campus; I had a large cluster of chance encounters on the Sadler Center Terrace, which has earned a reputation for chance encounters already. Most students will agree that you can’t walk across Terrace without seeing someone you know! </p>
				<p>Points are color-coded according to the duration of the interaction. The colors reveal that many of my “quick hellos” happen along my walking paths. Viewers can also choose to filter the map by relationship category—close friend, friend, colleague, acquaintance, and stranger—by clicking on any bar in the bar chart. Filtering the plotted points using the bar charts reveals interesting patterns. I most often see my close friends and friends in social student hubs like the dorms, the Sadler Center and Sunken Garden. I see colleagues more often in study spaces like Swem Library and the Integrated Science Center (home to my research lab, the <a href="https://geolab.wm.edu/">W&M geoLab </a>). I see acquaintances in locations scattered around campus with no clear clustering. I imagine this is because acquaintance is the most general term—we can meet acquaintances in many different places. </p>
				<p>The map also reveals where I spend the most time. Anyone familiar with the listed buildings could guess where I live, eat, go to class, walk between classes, and spend my free time. </p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>I first connected with this idea while listening to a talk from Yale psychology professor, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2021/01/08/laurie-santos-yale-happiness-professor-5-things-that-will-make-you-happier-1556182.html">Laurie Santos</a>. The talk challenged people’s expectations about happiness, the of directing one’s happiness toward others (even when it feels like a personal sacrifice), and our relationship to the present moment. </p>
			<p>Chance encounters are an overlooked opportunity to make others feel accepted and create a culture that values strangers as if they were friends. That culture already exists at William & Mary. So, it is our job as students to recognize the privilege of knowing almost everyone around you, and project that feeling onto everyone we encounter on elevators, coffee shops, and busy streets in the real world. </p>
